How The DFS Works:

To start the DFS, we must first run the metadata server:

sudo python meta_data.py

After that, we procede to create as many data nodes as necessary:

sudo python data_node.py  <PortNumber >  <DirectoryName>

*BE SURE TO NOT USE THE SAME PORT NUMBER WHEN CREATING DATA NODES. 
*If the DirectoryName doesnâ€™t exist, the Data Node creates it

After running the metadata server and creating some data nodes, we are ready to send files to the DFS.

To write a file to the DFS use this command:

python kopy.py <Path Of The File> <Metadata-Server-IP-Address:Path On The DFS> 

*If the file doesn't exist, an error is displayed

To read a file from the DFS use this command:

python kopy.py <Metadata-Server-IP-Address:Path On The DFS> <Path Of The File>

*If the file doesn't exist on the DFS, an error is displayed
