How the DFS Works:

Start MySQL database:

mysql.server start

Then you must run the metadata server:
 
sudo python meta_data.py

After that, you can create as many nodes as desired:

python data_node <PortNumber> <Path>

*DON’T REPEAT PORT NUMBERS
*If the DirectoryName doesn’t exist, the Data Node creates it

You’re ready to transfer files to the DFS:

To write files to the DFS use this command:

python kopy.py <Path Of The File> <Metadata-Server-IP-Address:Path On The DFS> 

*If the file doesn't exist, an error is displayed

To read a file from the DFS use this command:

python kopy.py <Metadata-Server-IP-Address:Path On The DFS> <Path Of The File>

*If the file doesn't exist on the DFS, an error is displayed
